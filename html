                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on identifying and mitigating two common web application attacks: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (SQLi).

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

Objective: Explore and demonstrate various types of XSS attacks.
Implementation: Create scenarios to showcase reflected XSS, stored XSS, and DOM-based XSS. Implement defenses like input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
SQL Injection (SQLi):

Objective: Understand and counter SQL injection attacks.
Implementation: Simulate SQL injection attacks on a web application with vulnerable inputs. Implement parameterized queries and prepared statements to secure against SQL injection.
Key Components:

Vulnerable Web Application: Develop a simple web application with intentional vulnerabilities for educational purposes.

Attack Scenarios: Create detailed scenarios illustrating how XSS and SQLi attacks can be executed.

Defense Mechanisms: Implement security measures such as input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries, and prepared statements to defend against these attacks.

Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation explaining the attack vectors, defense mechanisms, and steps to secure a web application against XSS and SQLi..</p>
